# Anthill

Library and an optional minimal runtime framework, for 
a pluggable and refactorable Everything-As-A-Code

### Solution Architecture
High level description of components of the solution.

### Solution Design
A concrete implementation of the architecture. One solution would
normally have one architecture at any point in time, but multiple 
designs.

## Hello world

Let's take a simple solution as an example. We want to have
a simple API that will return "Hello, world".
